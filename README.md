Simple HTML rendering using canvas!

This was a small programming assignment for a job application where I was to create simple HTML rendering in canvas. Currenly it only supports text boxes, buttons, check boxes, and text. The idea is to expand it so that it can render HTML strings and have full interaction and use CSS strings as well for styling.
